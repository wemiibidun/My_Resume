## Hi & Welcome! ðŸ‘‹


This is a sketch of my resume which I created with HTML and styled with CSS

**Aim**

The aim of this project was to create a resume that showcased my work experience and skills

**What I learnt**

- In this project, I learnt more about HTML 5 and CSS3 elements and tags

- I learnt how to comment in HTML and CSS

- I learnt how to create a table with `table row` & `table data` tags

- Some of the HTML elements/tags that I learnt are: `table row` `table data` `unordered list` `ordered list` `image tags` amongst others

- I also learnt how to insert images into a webpage

- Linking my css stylesheet to my HTML was another great lesson

- Finally, in CSS, I learnt how to add `background-color` `border-style` `width` amongst others

**My Take Home**

- You need HTML and CSS to build a beautiful website. HTML can be used for the skeletal and foundational work while CSS is the backbone for styling.

- I wrote more about the lessons I learnt [here](http://www.wemiibidun.com/2019/10/5-differences-between-html-css.html)

- This was a fun project for me. I learnt a lot about HTML elements and tags and I was also able to build my first resume from this.
